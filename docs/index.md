### **Deploy App:** *Enroll your team & handle their access to your C2, all from one place. So get controlling your battlespace quickly.*
  
Products available with Deploy App:
- **TAK**: *Situational awareness app from U.S. DoD.*
- **Battlelog**: *Write up & manage what happens in your Area of Operations.* 

Deploy App makes you capable to start using **a decentralized military-grade server for your unit**, without any prior training. Enroll your team with and make them benefit from your C2 software quickly. Deploy App provides a certificate-based identity to each team members' device, handling everything under the hood automatically so that your team Just Can:tm: access things built to work with Deploy App.

Once your team is enrolled, you can manage their access nicely. Promote admins that can add & manage your team. Revoke users on need. Once we're done implementing group management, you can determine specific things to be shared with specific people - same groups across each app you use, all managed from single view.

## Why Deploy App?
- **Fire & forget:** Just deploy one to your unit. Five minutes and go. 
- **Fine:** We deliver only what we can trust - and multiply endlessly. **No** for anything that's not real-world secure, usable or completely duplicable.
- (Almost) **Foolproof**: Our ideal is that only what's simple is good & can be used *en masse.* While we're not satisfied yet, we're going there.
