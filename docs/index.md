# Deploy App Docs

**Deploy App:** *Enroll your team & handle their access, all from one place.*
  
Products available with Deploy App:
- **TAK**: *Situational awareness app from U.S. DoD.*
- **Battlelog**: *Write up & manage what happens in your Area of Operations.* 


## Deploy App

Deploy App makes you capable to enroll your team quickly & securely to your decentralized server. It provides a certificate-based identity to each team members' device, and handles everything under the hood so that you can just access apps in your server & get resources in how to use them.

Once your team is enrolled, you can manage them - promote admins that can add & manage your team, and revoke users on need. We're incorporating group management into it aswell, so that you can determine specific things to be shared with specific people. On top of this, Deploy App aims to be a platform to especially military users, into which you as a developer can integrate your product.
