# 2. Add users
Once you got your admin identity to your dedicated server, it's time to start add users. This is how it works.

### In a nutshell - Add users
1. Create an Invite Code. It works until you disable or remove it.
2. Either show your users the Invite QR, or copy and paste them the Invite Link. Both do the same.
3. Approve users by scanning the unique Approval QR from their screens, or having them copy & paste their Approval Link to you. 
4. Ready!
