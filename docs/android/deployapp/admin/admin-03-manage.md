# 3. Manage & revoke users
You can elevate users to **Admins** as you and Revoke them to deny their access to Deploy App and all associated services. In the future, you can also manage user groups from here.

### In a nutshell - Add users
1. Create an Invite Code. It works until you disable or remove it.
2. Either show your users the Invite QR, or copy and paste them the Invite Link. Both do the same.
3. Approve users by scanning the unique Approval QR from their screens, or having them copy & paste their Approval Link to you. 
4. Ready!
