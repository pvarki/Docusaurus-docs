## Why Deploy App?
- **Fire & forget:** Just deploy one to your unit. Five minutes and go. 
- **Fine:** We deliver only what we can trust - and multiply endlessly. **No** for anything that's not real-world secure, usable or completely duplicable.
- (Almost) **Foolproof**: Our ideal is that only what's simple is good & can be used *en masse.* While we're not satisfied yet, we're going there.
