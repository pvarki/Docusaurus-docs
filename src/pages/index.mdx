## Basic Deploy App flow
Not willing to go through all the docs? This is how it works.

<div className="reveal-wrapper" style={{height:'600px'}}>
  <iframe
    src="/decks/en/intro/"
    title="Deploy App Slides"
    allow="fullscreen; autoplay; clipboard-write"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style={{border:0}}
  />
</div>

### In a nutshell
1. Use an Invite Code to invite your user  
2. User types in their callsign  
3. User needs to be accepted by **you**, the admin  
4. Once accepted, user installs their Identity Certificate  
5. That’s it—user can now access TAK & assorted products.

*One minute if they’re familiar with Deploy App and TAK, ≈30 minutes if
this is the first time.*
