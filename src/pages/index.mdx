# Deploy App

Deploy App lets you enroll your team and manage their access into your
team’s services. All in matter of minutes, from total zero to ready
to operate.

## Basic Deploy App flow
Not willing to go through all the docs? This is how it works.

<div className="reveal-wrapper" style={{ height: '600px' }}>
  <SlideDeck deckPath="intro" height={600} />
</div>

### In a nutshell
1. Use an Invite Code to invite your user  
2. User types in their callsign  
3. User needs to be accepted by **you**, the admin  
4. Once accepted, user installs their Identity Certificate  
5. That’s it—user can now access TAK & assorted products.

*One minute if they’re familiar with Deploy App and TAK, ≈30 minutes if
this is the first time.*
