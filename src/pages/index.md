### In a nutshell
1. Use an Invite Code to invite your user
2. User types in their callsign
3. User needs to be accepted by You, the admin in one Deploy App server
4. Once accepted, user installs their Identity Certificate
5. That' it, user can now access TAK & assorted products. Guides are included in-app so that user should get through it. 

One minute if they're familiar with Deploy App and TAK, 30 minutes if this is the first time.
