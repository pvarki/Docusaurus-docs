### Typical Issues
1. "Invalid Cert" issue
2. Your Browser Not Supported

Deploy App should run pretty error-free (If you encounter them, please do report!).

### 2. Browser Not Supported
Due how iPhones work with browsers, on iOS we only support the **Safari** browser.
- You can't work with Chrome/Brave/others on iOS/iPhone.
