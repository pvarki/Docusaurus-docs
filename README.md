## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate documentation site for the Rasenmaeher project. The documentation is built using Docusaurus, a modern static site generator, and hosted using Nginx in a Docker container.

## Features

- **Automated Documentation Fetching**: Automatically fetches and updates documentation from the main repository and its submodules.
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying the documentation.
- **Docker Integration**: Builds the static documentation site into a Docker image with Nginx for hosting.
- **i18n**: Locales, presently for English (standard) and Finnish
- **Reveal.js decks**: Write standalone, portable powerpoints with MD & Mermaid. Localization integration. Mobile-friendly mode for small screens.
