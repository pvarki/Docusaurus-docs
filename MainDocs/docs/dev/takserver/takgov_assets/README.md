# Assets from tak.gov

Place the docker distro and plugin zips you downloaded here.

Naming should follow the following scheme:

  - takserver-docker-4.7-RELEASE-44.zip for the main distro
  - tak-server-4.7-sdk.zip for the plugins SDK (which also contains built plugins)

Then you can use the Dockefile_build to place the zips into an image that can be pulled from docker hub.

CIV version can be re-distributed freely. The others variants can't be (legally) re-distributed at all by
the general "click-wrap" -license, if you have a separate license that of course might have different
terms.
